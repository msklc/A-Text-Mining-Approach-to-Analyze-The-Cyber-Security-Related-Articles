0,0110599,"The investigators will conduct a series of experiments that focus on crucial substantive implications of modeling social interaction as the result of a cybernetic process of meaning  whereby actors behave so as to maintain meanings in the situation.   describes a  system between identities and actions, with identity meanings acting as a reference level for interpreting social interactions.  Specifically, it suggests that people will not only try to maintain their own identities, but will also strive to restore the identities of others with whom they are interacting.  The theory also incorporates the restorative actions of other actors into the model.  If another person in the interaction takes a restorative action, it may restore the meanings so that no further reparation is necessary.  The studies described here propose to test these key predictions that differentiate  from the other major  perspective.  Study  challenges (negatively deflects) the identity of an alter, and tests to see whether this challenge evokes restorative behavior from ego.  Study  creates an atypically positive interaction for the alter, to see if this evokes negative behavior by ego toward the alter (as predicted to be restorative of original meanings).  Study  draws on pre-test results that indicate  alternative means of restoring another is challenged identity.  Here, the investigator use computer-regulated interaction to make available alternative means of restoring another is identity.  The prediction involves the substitutability of different behaviors for meaning restoration.  Study  elaborates the substitutability of restorative action hypothesis.   The investigators will test whether or not a restorative act by  actor affects the probability of another actor is engaging in a restorative act.  Study  examines whether or not the identity of the actors influences the effect of the restorative behavior.  Taken together, the  experiments explore how we go about maintaining the identities of others, and how the social situation in which we are embedded affects those restorative efforts.

4,0133664,"There is a growing scientific community working to provide solid theoretical and algorithmic foundations for the study of communication s. This project furthers this goal through a combination of research and education. In particular, it addresses theoretical and algorithmic issues that arise in a central area of ing: the efficient utilization of communication bandwidth. The research compnt of this project addresses several different approaches for the succinct representation of information in communication s. This includes the investigation of (a) the efficient use of communication bits to provide accountability in the Internet (which is a means of combating cyber-terrorism), (b) new approaches to compression that arise in new communication technologies, and (c) minimizing the amount of  information required to make communication robust with respect to  faults. The integrated educational objectives of this project include both graduate student collaboration and curriculum development. The former consists of student involvement with the research compnt of the project, as well as organization of  schools and workshops. The later includes the incorporation of ing topics into a graduate level algorithms course, as well as the development of a new advanced graduate course addressing the algorithmic and theoretical challenges and achievements in the area of ing.  For the research question of providing accountability in the Internet, this project studies the   problem: given a stream of packets arriving at a node of the Internet, determine the source of those packets. This is an important tool for dealing with denial of service attacks, since accountability discourages such attacks and provides an automated mechanism for halting attacks in progress. This project studies probabilistic packet marking schemes for this problem, with the goal of determining the optimal tradeoffs between the number of marking bits used per packet, the number of packets required to reconstruct the source information, and the number of simultaneous sources of attack that can be dealt with. A number of new technologies also present us with entirely new approaches to compression. The resulting compression problems are fundamental, but since the motivating technologies have a short history, these problems have not been considered previously. In this project, we consider compression problems that arise from  such technologies: asymmetric communication channels, s that are able to multicast information efficiently, and the compression of . Finally, we also consider reducing bandwidth utilization by minimizing the amount of  information required to make communication robust against faults.","['growing', 'scientific', 'community', 'working', 'provide', 'solid', 'theoretical', 'algorithmic', 'foundation', 'study', 'communication', 'project', 'furthers', 'goal', 'combination', 'research', 'education', 'particular', 'address', 'theoretical', 'algorithmic', 'issue', 'arise', 'central', 'area', 'ing', 'efficient', 'utilization', 'communication', 'bandwidth', 'research', 'compnt', 'project', 'address', 'several', 'different', 'approach', 'succinct', 'representation', 'information', 'communication', 'includes', 'investigation', 'efficient', 'use', 'communication', 'bit', 'provide', 'accountability', 'internet', 'mean', 'combating', 'new', 'approach', 'compression', 'arise', 'new', 'communication', 'technology', 'minimizing', 'amount', 'information', 'required', 'make', 'communication', 'robust', 'respect', 'fault', 'integrated', 'educational', 'objective', 'project', 'include', 'graduate', 'student', 'collaboration', 'curriculum', 'development', 'former', 'consists', 'student', 'involvement', 'research', 'compnt', 'project', 'organization', 'school', 'workshop', 'later', 'includes', 'incorporation', 'ing', 'topic', 'graduate', 'level', 'algorithm', 'course', 'development', 'new', 'advanced', 'graduate', 'course', 'addressing', 'algorithmic', 'theoretical', 'challenge', 'achievement', 'area', 'ing', 'research', 'question', 'providing', 'accountability', 'internet', 'project', 'study', 'problem', 'given', 'stream', 'packet', 'arriving', 'node', 'internet', 'determine', 'source', 'packet', 'important', 'tool', 'dealing', 'denial', 'service', 'attack', 'since', 'accountability', 'discourages', 'attack', 'provides', 'automated', 'mechanism', 'halting', 'attack', 'progress', 'project', 'study', 'probabilistic', 'packet', 'marking', 'scheme', 'problem', 'goal', 'determining', 'optimal', 'tradeoff', 'number', 'marking', 'bit', 'used', 'per', 'packet', 'number', 'packet', 'required', 'reconstruct', 'source', 'information', 'number', 'simultaneous', 'source', 'attack', 'dealt', 'number', 'new', 'technology', 'present', 'entirely', 'new', 'approach', 'compression', 'resulting', 'compression', 'problem', 'fundamental', 'since', 'motivating', 'technology', 'short', 'history', 'problem', 'considered', 'previously', 'project', 'consider', 'compression', 'problem', 'arise', 'technology', 'asymmetric', 'communication', 'channel', 'able', 'multicast', 'information', 'efficiently', 'compression', 'finally', 'consider', 'reducing', 'bandwidth', 'utilization', 'minimizing', 'amount', 'information', 'required', 'make', 'communication', 'robust', 'fault']",growing scientific community working provide solid theoretical algorithmic foundation study communication project furthers goal combination research education particular address theoretical algorithmic issue arise central area ing efficient utilization communication bandwidth research compnt project address several different approach succinct representation information communication includes investigation efficient use communication bit provide accountability internet mean combating new approach compression arise new communication technology minimizing amount information required make communication robust respect fault integrated educational objective project include graduate student collaboration curriculum development former consists student involvement research compnt project organization school workshop later includes incorporation ing topic graduate level algorithm course development new advanced graduate course addressing algorithmic theoretical challenge achievement area ing research question providing accountability internet project study problem given stream packet arriving node internet determine source packet important tool dealing denial service attack since accountability discourages attack provides automated mechanism halting attack progress project study probabilistic packet marking scheme problem goal determining optimal tradeoff number marking bit used per packet number packet required reconstruct source information number simultaneous source attack dealt number new technology present entirely new approach compression resulting compression problem fundamental since motivating technology short history problem considered previously project consider compression problem arise technology asymmetric communication channel able multicast information efficiently compression finally consider reducing bandwidth utilization minimizing amount information required make communication robust fault,2
5,0140179,"     aspect of biocomplexity is the ability of biota to self-adjust to their environment.  Previous studies of adaptive behavior have shown that adaptive systems will evolve over time to states that are weakly chaotic, a condition known as the edge of chaos.  These studies typically use a genetic algorithm (computer-based evolution) to implement adaptation.  It is conjectured that most self-adjusting dynamical systems that initially have chaotic behavior will also adapt toward the edge of chaos.  A model for self-adjusting dynamical systems is introduced which treats the  parameters as slowly varying, rather than constant.  The dynamics of these parameters is assumed to be governed by some low-pass filtered feedback from the dynamical variables of the system.  Under the influence of noise, at least in numerical models, the probability of chaotic breakout shows a universal scaling with the duration of the breakouts.   of the model to biochemical oscillators as the simplest possible adaptive system relevent to environmental dynamics will be investigated.  A high degree of interdisciplinarity is required, as the research involves expertise in dynamical systems, plant biology, instrumental measurements, cybernetics, enzymology, chemistry, and physics.  The system is chosen to be ""biocomplex,"" yet simple enough that meaningful measurements can be made and quantitative models can be evaluated.  We ind to experimentally demonstrate adaptation using the peroxidase-oxidase oscillator as an example.  This system is known to exhibit non-linear, complex, and even chaotic behavior.  We will explore if the in situ behavior of this enzyme provides the  experimental evidence for adaptation to the edge of chaos in a naturally occurring system.  Detailed chemical models are available to guide our experiments. We will experimentally implement low-pass filtered feedback from the dynamical variables to the  parameters through: . a computer based probe-actuator system, and  . the comparatively slow response of the metabolism of a thin section    of horseradish root tissues suspended in a reactor, and check for    adaptation to the edge of chaos, and critical scaling of chaotic    outbreaks of chemical oscillations.  Outreach activities to local  schools will be incorporated into our existing collaborations with high school science teachers.  If our initial experiments on plant peroxidases show the anticipated complexity, we will then explore the related complexity in the behavior of peroxidases and oxidases in human neutrophils, cells associated with anti-bacterial activity and response to systemic afronts.

9,0202284,"Abstract  :  DMS-  Title: Saddlepoint and  and    systems underlie the models applied in most areas of modern science. These concepts have evolved over a long period of time but were heavily influenced more recently by the cybernetics movement spanning  until the late s. Those involved on the electrical engineering side of this movement used flow graphs to represent the systems. Interesting time-dependent system characteristics were naturally characterized in terms of the  transforms that could be associated with the flow graph. Their efforts lead to a general theory of finite state  systems that generalized the very restrictive  systems that are commonly applied even . Unfortunately, the inversion of the transforms in this approach proved to be a challenge that ultimately limited the impact of the flow graphs. This proposal addresses these inversions along with other missing tools so that a general systems theory may be fully developed into a complete mathematical discipline. These inversion tools, using saddlepoint methods, allow for the determination of the transient behavior of complex systems. In addition, the bootstrap is introduced for nonparametric statistical inference about the true system based on system observation. The range of applications in the engineering and biomedical sciences include communication and computer s, queueing theory, multi-state survival models, and right/left and interval censoring in the ext of the competing risks associated with such models. More specifically, this proposal addresses the following issues: () ew techniques are required for inverting the  transforms that characterize the complex behavior of systems; the author proposes several new saddlepoint methods for achieving this by using the method of steepest descents. () Transforms describing system characteristics need to be specified in ways that make the saddlepoint methods easy to use.  is rule is used but, because of its form, it is much too complicated to apply to large systems. The author has proposed several alternative co-factor rules that greatly simplify computations for the saddlepoint inversions. () onparametric statistical inference is to be developed for such  systems using the bootstrap and its relationship to empirical transforms. The single and double bootstrap lead to a practical means for computing confidence bands of survival and hazard functions related to the  process. The proposed double bootstrap is implemented through saddlepoint inversions.  This proposal studies the statistical and probabilistic traits of dynamic stochastic systems with feedback. The models for such systems are commonly used to make extrapolations and predictions in most areas of modern science. In engineering, for example, a communication or computer system changes from state to state and the dynamics of these state transitions determine the evolution of the system. This proposal considers the computation and estimation of reliability or performance evaluation for such an evolving dynamic system. The proposed methods have important applications in reliability analysis, electrical engineering, biomedical sciences and manufacturing.

13,0208779," logic is a semantic foundation for implementing evidential transactions using the public key infrastructure ().  Evidential transactions form the basis of frameworks for authorization and authentication, electronic commerce, business workflow, and  government.  Such transactions involve the exchange of physical evidence in the form of identity cards, driver is licenses, my, checks, visas, airline tickets, traffic tickets, birth certificates, and stock certificates, as well as electronic evidence including  numbers, passwords, keys, certificates, and nonces.  logic is an enabling foundation for building and analyzing protocols that involve the exchange of electronic forms of evidence.  logic builds on evidence, public keys, and protocols.  , evidence is encoded by means of numbers using  certificates and nonces. , public keys are predicates so that any information $i$ signed by a private key corresponding to the public key $P$ entails that $P$ holds of $i$.  Indeed, the signed certificate is a proof for the assertion ained in the certificate.  , protocols are distributed logic programs that gather evidence by using both ordinary predicates and  certificates.

Even well administered s are vulnerable to attacks due to the security ramifications of offering a variety of combined services. That is, services that are secure when offered in isolation ntheless provide an attacker with combined vulnerabilities to exploit when offered simultaneously.  Security tools such as COPS, System Scanner, and , are excellent at identifying specific, known, individual host vulnerabilities in services, software packages, and configurations. What these methods do not address is the compound effect of multiple vulnerabilities.  The result is a serious problem because interactions between vulnerabilities can easily cascade across a .  The risk posed by each vulnerability may be judged either necessary or acceptable in isolation, but the combination of these vulnerabilities can still turn out to compromise the  as a whole in an unacceptable way.

18,0216981,"In the s, the birth and development of modern computers suggested the notion that minds, or brains, are computers. This thesis combined the advent of computers with both the old idea that reasoning is a form of calculation (from  to formal logic) and the materialist doctrine that reasoning, and more generally cognition, is carried out by the brain. The view that the mind-brain is a computer, here called computationalism, is the topic of this dissertation research project. The project will trace different versions of computationalism from their historical root in the cybernetics movement to the many disciplines that incorporated it. It will complement recent scholarship in related areas by showing how early attempts at mathematical modeling of the brain, the development of new mathematical and modeling tools, and new hypotheses about memory mechanisms came together to form a novel conceptual and methodological framework for studying the functional organization of the mind-brain. The study will interest not only historians, but also those who work in the sciences of mind and brain and those who are interested in their foundations. This research includes both a philosophical and a historical compnt. The piers who developed computationalism and many of  is concepts--A. , J. , . , and --had clearer motivations for their views than their followers of . Through understanding the reasoning of the piers--the roots of  is positions--within their historical ext, and studying how that ext has since changed, the investigators hope to shed light on  is views. In order to carry out the historical compnt of this project, they will rely on published material in history, philosophy, and science, as well as unpublished material. Funding for this project will support  trips to archives aining the unpublished papers of ,  , , and . Aside from its historical interest, clarifying the history of computationalism has several potial benefits.  In the philosophy of mind and brain sciences, this project would illuminate current discussions of computationalism by showing what historical e computationalism played and still plays in shaping research programs in different disciplines. In addition, in philosophy of mind, it may stimulate functionalist philosophers, many of whom rely on computationalism, to rethink some of their views. It may equip funding agencies to more efficiently distribute research funds. And, finally, it would affect science and technology education. Through the future publication of articles directed at the general public and the design of an undergraduate course on Computers, Minds, and , the expertise developed in this project would ribute to the education of the general public about computers and their relationship with psychology and neuroscience.

19,0219538,"Proposal Abstract Proposal  ITR: E-neighbors: Social erks and  in the Internet Age ,   This research addresses concerns about the impact of Internet and computer use on community and family life. Through an empirical analysis of  case studies, this research project  examines the current relationship between Internet use and the size and composition of people is social s, and ii) explores the potial for new information and communication technologies to expand social s, social capital and community involvement at the local level.  This project is motivated by recent concerns that ns have became more cynical; are spending less time with friends, relatives and neighbors; and have become less involved in clubs and organizations. Past research has concluded with mixed results as to whether the Internet further dissociates people from those around them, or if it holds the potial to reconnect the disaffiliated. The adult residents of   area neighborhoods have been asked to complete detailed surveys on the composition, structure, and supportive  of their personal and neighborhood social s. This project will analyze the results of those surveys and compare residents based on their level of technology use and the structure of their social s. Following the  wave of surveying  of the  neighborhoods will be given access to a series of Internet services designed to facilitate communication and the sharing of information at the neighborhood level. A  and  waves of surveying will compare the  experimental neighborhoods with a  group, examining the impact of the provided Internet services on residents' social s and their involvement in neighborhood and community activities.  It is vital to address concerns about declining of social capital in , and any e that the Internet and home computing might have in inuing or reversing this decline. While the existing trend of reduced community participation originates to early to be associated with new information and communication technologies, the fear is that home computing will further accelerate this trend. The project investigators expect that this is not the case. Previous research in this area of privileges the Internet as a social system removed from the other ways people communicate. ing into cyberspace and ignoring the  of social relations that exded to other social settings, fails to consider the crosscutting nature of community, including the many ways and the many places people interact. By embracing a social  perspective this project will demonstrate that Internet users have larger, more diverse social s, and that they are more active communicators both on and off line. This research will also demonstrate that the growth of home computing and Internet use has the potial to reverse the existing trend of community noninvolvement. This study will show that the introduction of Internet services designed for use at the neighborhood level can increase the size and diversity of local social s. Previous research points to the e of this type of social capital in facilitating a number of positive community outcomes, including; increased housing values and the prevention of neighborhood decline; helping youth find job acts and avoiding social problems including, drugs, crime and teen pregnancy; increased neighborhood safety and reducing crime; and increases overall health.

25,0225421,"   The science erk () project seeks to bring leading-edge information management research to bear on creating a cyberinfrastructure for the solid earth geosciences to interlink multidisciplinary geoscience data sets in D space.  The need to manage the growing amounts of diverse  science data has been recognized through a series of -sponsored community meetings on .  The  collaboration between IT researchers, who represent key technology areas relevant to , and  science researchers, who represent a broad cross section of  science sub-disciplines, will provide the foundation for a national  program.  There is a pressing need in the  sciences for a national information infrastructure that enables the community to share databases and tools to enable interdisciplinary analysis of ed data sets in studying a wide range of phenomena including the interplay between tectonics and the evolution of sedimentary basins;  the e of mountain building in the evolution of climate and life;  broader predictive understanding and modeling capabilities of geologic hazards, such as earthquakes and volcanoes;  the D reconstruction of  the  through time;  and, managing the natural resources of our planet. Each of these problems requires interdisciplinary research to discover relationships among  science disciplines, and depends on the community is ability to construct an integrated geoscience information system.  The goal of  is to develop the necessary IT foundations and create such a system.  Many past and on-going projects in the geosciences have produced valuable sub-disciplinary and disciplinary databases.  umerous national centers and organizations such as , , the ational  (CEAS), the  quake   (SCEC), as well as government agencies such as  (), are ributing research and data to the community.
